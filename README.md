# Titanic Survival Analysis and Prediction | End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project explores and analyses the famous Titanic dataset to uncover insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival. 

Using data analysis and a complete machine learning pipeline to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## This project demonstrates my practical skills in Deployment and covers the full Machine Learning lifecycle:

-Data cleaning and prepocessing
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Data Visualization
-Feature engineering and relationships
-Model building / Trainng
-Model Evaluation And Comparison
-Model Optimization
-Data Interpretation - (Model Deployment using Streamlit)


## Dataset Information

Files used:

-train.csv - Training Data
-test.csv - Test Data

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including Features:

-Age
-Gender
-Passsenger Class
-Fare
-Embarkation Port

While Target:

-Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

## Tools and Technologies Used

-Python
-Pandas
-Numpy
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Scikit-learn
-Jupyter Notebook
-Git & Github
-Joblib
-Streamlit
-Git & Github

## Key Analysis Performed Using Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Data Cleaning

-Handled Missing Values
-Survival Rate Analysis
-Survival by Passenger Class
-Age Distribution Analysis
-Coverted categorical variables
-Removed irrelevant features

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Key insights:

-Females had higher survival rate
-First-class passengers survived more
-Removed irrelevant features

### 3. Feature Engineering

-Encoded categorical variables
-Scaled numerical features

### 4. Model Training 

Models trained:

-Logistic Regression
-Random Forest Classifier

### 5. Model Evaluation

Metrics Used:

-Accuracy
-Confusion Matrix
-ROC Curve
-Cross Validation and model comparison

Best Model Accuracy:

**80%** (Logistic Regression)

### 6. Model Deployment

Deployed using Streamlit

Users can predict survival interactively.

## Live App Features

Users Inputs:

-Age
-Gender
-Passenger Class
-Fare
-Siblings and Spouse Aboard
-Parents and Children Aboard
-Embarked

App predicts survival instantly.
