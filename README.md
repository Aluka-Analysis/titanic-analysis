# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores and analyses the famous Titanic dataset to uncover insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival. 

Using data analysis and machine learning techniques. I performed data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and feature analysis to understand survival patterns.

## This project demonstrates my practical skills in:

-Data cleaning and prepocessing
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Data Visualization
-Feature engineering and relationships
-Model building
-Data Interpretation
-Evaluation and insights

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including:
-Age
-Gender
-Passsenger Class
-Fare
-Embarkation Port
-Survival Status

Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

## Tools and Technologies Used

-Python
-Pandas
-Numpy
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Scikit-learn
-Jupyter Notebook
-Git & Github

## Key Analysis Performed

-Data Cleaning
-Handling Missing Values
-Survival Rate Analysis
-Survival by Passenger Class
-Age Distribution Analysis
-Data Visulization using charts and graphs

## key Insights

Some important findings include:
-Females had a higher survival rate than males
-First-class passengers had higher survival chances
-Younger passengers had a slightly better survival rates
-Passenger class strongly influenced survival

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to practice real-world data analysis and machine learning workflow and build portfolio projects that demonstrates my ability as a Data Analyst
